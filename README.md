The bisection method finds the root of a given continous function. This program uses the function:

  ![](http://rogercortesi.com/eqn/tempimagedir/eqn5996.png)

It askes the user for

* Point A
* Point B
* Tolerance

using these two points from the user, it narrows down in which interval the root lies in. Once finding out in which interval it lies in, 
whether   ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ba%2C%20midpoint%5D%20or%20%5Bmidpoint%2C%20b%5D) , it then chooses that sub interval to repeat the process to get to the root.
